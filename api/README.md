# Academic Paper Clustering API

This is the Flask API backend for the Academic Paper Clustering project. It connects the React frontend to the PySpark clustering backend.

## Features

- RESTful API for data collection, clustering, and visualization
- Background job processing for long-running tasks
- Serves visualizations generated by the PySpark backend
- Serves the React frontend in production

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- PySpark and all dependencies from the main project
- Flask

### Installation

1. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install flask pandas
```

The other dependencies should already be installed if you've set up the main project.

### Running the API Server

Start the API server:

```bash
cd api
python app.py
```

This will start the Flask server on port 5000.

## API Endpoints

### Project Statistics
- `GET /api/stats` - Get project statistics

### Data Collection
- `POST /api/collect-data` - Start data collection from ArXiv
- `GET /api/job-status/<job_id>` - Check status of a running job

### Clustering
- `POST /api/cluster` - Start clustering process
- `GET /api/clustered-papers` - Get the list of clustered papers

### Visualizations
- `GET /api/visualizations` - Get visualization URLs
- `GET /visualizations/<filename>` - Serve visualization files
- `GET /api/download-visualizations` - Download all visualizations

## Development

For development, the API server and React development server should be run separately:

1. Run the API server on port 5000
2. Run the React development server on port 3000

The React app is configured to proxy API requests to port 5000.

## Production

For production, build the React app and the Flask server will serve the static files:

```bash
# Build the React app
cd frontend
npm run build

# Run the Flask server
cd ../api
python app.py
```

Then access the application at http://localhost:5000
